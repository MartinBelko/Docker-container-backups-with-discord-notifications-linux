# Docker-container-backups-with-discord-notifications-linux
Basic script to stop a container and back up the contents, where your config files are at the same place as the config folders, to a samba share with discord notifications using webhook. 

Personally i use Hetzner storage box for my backups, and i dont really bother using ssh, so i went back and forth with github copilot, chatgpt and gemini to create whatever this is (i dont know myself).
